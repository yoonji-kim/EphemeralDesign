# Mystic Message
We designed Mystic Message, a display that prints ephemeral fog letters to provide answers to usersâ€™ questions. Unlike most conversational interfaces designed nowadays, Mystic Message creates novel experiences through asymmetric exchange of information occurs using an unusual medium of communication: fog. As such, it provides users with amusing experiences. Fog is first generated by a fog machine and then pushed out through a screen-printed template using an air pump. One of the three answers, yes, no, and hmm, is then randomly printed out in the form of fog for each question. Mystic Message can be developed as media art piece installed at various places so that visitors can freely experience it. Furthermore, it is expected to be installed at places beyond an art exhibition, such as shopping centers, amusement parks, or any places in our daily life to be freely enjoyed.
